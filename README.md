# Uber-Ride-Network-Tree

This Java project is a tool for analyzing a special ride network created daily by Uber. The tool's objective is to determine whether the ride network, represented as a directed graph, meets the criteria of being a tree. Specifically, it checks whether the directed graph has one less edge than the number of vertices, is connected, and contains no cycles.


## Introduction

As a software developer at Uber, you are tasked with verifying whether the daily ride network, represented as a directed graph, satisfies the conditions of being a tree. It is essential to ensure that the network structure is suitable for efficient ride operations.

## Features

- Analysis of a directed graph to determine if it meets the tree criteria.
- Verification of one less edge than the number of vertices, connectivity, and absence of cycles.
- Clear and extensible Java codebase.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile and run the Java program using your preferred Java development environment.

3. Follow the prompts to input the necessary parameters and perform the ride network analysis.

## Usage

To use the Uber Ride Network Analysis tool, follow these steps:

1. Run the Java program.

2. Provide input parameters such as the number of vertices, number of edges, and edge information.

3. The program will analyze the directed graph and display whether it meets the tree criteria or not.

## Input Format

In the input, you will provide the following information:

- The number of vertices (N) representing ride network locations.
- The number of edges (M) representing ride connections.
- M lines containing edge information, each specifying a directed edge from one vertex to another.

## Output Format

The output will indicate whether the provided directed graph meets the conditions of being a tree. It will also provide additional information about the analysis, such as whether it has one less edge than the number of vertices, is connected, and whether any cycles are present.
