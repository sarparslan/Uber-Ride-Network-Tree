# Uber-Ride-Network-Tree
You started as a software developer in the Uber company. In this company, a special ride network
is created every day. And your first task is to prove whether you can keep this company's ride
network in a tree structure. But the developer who left the company before you has already
designed this network using a directed graph. Your task is to measure whether this directed graph
can be a tree. After some research, you found that for a directed graph to be a tree, it must have
2
one less number of edges than the number of vertices, it must be connected, and there must be no
cycles in the graph. Now prove to your team leader that you can solve this problem.
Note: Here you must use the symbol chart data structure when retrieving taxi pickups from the user.
